# discordC2
This Discord C2 is just a proof of concept that you can pretty much turn anything into a C2 comms channel. 
I'm going to make a few more using other methods as well. Async C2 communication channels aren't typically detected by EDR so you can be very creative here.

## FAQ
- How did you get it to compile to exe? I used pyinstaller --onefile discordc2.py
- Yeah what about the token? it is hard cod... ? I KNOW. It's a POC, to prove that it's possible. This is just the basic on how it would work. Go figure out your own obfuscations.
- Did you take consideration some OPSEC? Isn't this bad cod.. ? NO I did not. I don't care. It's a POC, to prove that it's possible. This is just the basic on how it would work. Please go ahead and write your own better version.
